\subsection*{Problem description}
There are $\pa$ real coins and $\pb$ counterfeit coins($0<\pa,\pb$),  real coins have the same weight and so are the counterfeit ones.But a real coin is heavier than a fake one.
Each comparison compares whether two coins have the same weight or the heavier one if different.

Assume we know $\pa,\pb$.
Find the minimum number of comparison that we can garantee to find a real coin and a fake one.
