\section{Introduction}
\subsection*{Problem description}
Now we have a's "+" and b's "-", each time we can choose 2 of them to check if they are the same or not.  $\tau(a,b)$ is the minimum number of testing that we can garantee to find a different pair "+" and "-".  \\


\subsection*{Idea}
Consider a graph G(a,b) contains two part, one is $K_a$, another is $K_b$, then we want to find a graph g(a,b) (vetex is not greater than a+b), ang g(a,b) is not a subgraph of G(a,b). Let $t =$ numer of edge of g(a,b), then through  $t$ testing we can   garantee to find a different pair "+" and "-".  \\

\begin{proof}
We tesing as edge of g(a,b). If we can't find the pair "+" and "-" after "t" testing, we can assign a's "+" and b's "-" into g(a,b),  then g(a,b) is the subgraph og G(a,b). By contradiction. \\
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
$\tau(a,b)= min(t)$ 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For any graph contains the nunber of edges is less than $min(t)$, imply the graph is a subgraph of G(a,b), then we can conclude that exist a probability greater than 0 that we can not  find a different pair "+" and "-".
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Conclusion}
We want to find a graph g(a,b) that has minimum edges and g(a,b) is not the subgraph of G(a,b), then number of edges of g(a,b) is the answer.
